                <p id="titulo">Vincent Willem van Gogh</p>
                <p id="fecha">(30 March 1853 - 29 July 1890)
                </p>
                <p id="parrafo1">Was a Post-Impressionist painter of Dutch origin whose workâ€”notable for its rough
                    beauty, emotional honesty, and bold colorâ€”had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art. After
                    years of painful anxiety and frequent bouts of mental illness, he died aged 37 from a gunshot wound,
                    generally accepted to be self-inflicted (although no gun was ever found). His work was then known to
                    only a handful of people and appreciated by fewer still.
                </p>
                <p id="parrafo2">Van Gogh began to draw as a child, and he continued to draw throughout the years that
                    led up to his decision to become an artist. He did not begin painting until his late twenties,
                    completing many of his best-known works during the last two years of his life. In just over a
                    decade, he produced more than 2,100 artworks, consisting of 860 oil paintings and more than 1,300
                    watercolors, drawings, sketches, and prints. His work included self portraits, landscapes, still
                    lifes, portraits as well as paintings of cypresses, wheat fields and sunflowers.

                <p id="parrafo3">

                    He spent his early adulthood working for a firm of art dealers, traveling between The Hague, London,
                    and Paris, after which he taught for a time in England at Isleworth and Ramsgate. One of his early
                    aspirations was to become a pastor, and from 1879 he worked as a missionary in a mining region in
                    Belgium, where he began to sketch people from the local community. In 1885, he painted his first
                    major work, entitled The Potato Eaters. His palette at the time consisted mainly of somber earth
                    tones and showed no sign of the vivid coloration that distinguished his later work. In March 1886,
                    he moved to Paris and discovered the French Impressionists. Later, he moved to the south of France
                    and was influenced by the strong sunlight he found there. His work grew brighter in color, and he
                    developed the unique and highly recognizable style that became fully realized during his stay in
                    Arles in 1888.

                <p id="parrafo4">The extent to which his mental health affected his painting has been a subject of
                    speculation since
                    his death. Despite a widespread tendency to romanticize his ill health, modern critics see an artist
                    deeply frustrated by the inactivity and incoherence brought about by his bouts of illness. According
                    to
                    art critic Robert Hughes, Van Gogh's late works show an artist at the height of his ability,
                    completely
                    in control and "longing for concision and grace".
                </p>

                <p id="parrafo5">
                    The most comprehensive primary source for the understanding of Van Gogh as an artist is the
                    collection of letters between him and his younger brother, art dealer Theo van Gogh. They lay the
                    foundation for most of what is known about the thoughts and beliefs of the artist. Theo provided his
                    brother with both financial and emotional support. Their lifelong friendship, and most of what is
                    known of Van Gogh's thoughts and theories of art, is recorded in the hundreds of letters they
                    exchanged between 1872 and 1890: more than 600 from Vincent to Theo and 40 from Theo to Vincent.

                </p>
                <p id="parrafo6">Although many are undated, art historians have generally been able to put them in
                    chronological
                    order. Problems remain, mainly in dating those from Arles, although it is known that during that
                    period, Van Gogh wrote 200 letters to friends in Dutch, French and English. The period when Vincent
                    lived in Paris is the most difficult for historians to analyze because the brothers lived together
                    and had no need to correspond.

                <p id="parrafo7">
                    In addition to letters to and from Theo, other surviving documents include those to Van Rappard,
                    Émile Bernard, Van Gogh's sister Wil and her friend Line Kruysse. The letters were first annotated
                    in 1913 by Theo's widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger who explained that she published them with
                    "trepidation" because she did not want the drama in the artist's life to overshadow his work. Van
                    Gogh himself was an avid reader of other artists' biographies and expected their lives to be in
                    keeping with the character of their art.
